# Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from Scratch with TensorFlow

## Overview
This repository contains a project demonstrating how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow from scratch. The project uses the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on four features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width.

The ANN model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, trained on the Iris dataset, and evaluated for its performance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 rows and 4 features: 
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target variable has 3 classes of flower species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and scaling the data.
2. **Model Building**: Creating the ANN model with TensorFlow.
3. **Model Training**: Training the model on the Iris dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model on test data and obtaining accuracy.
5. **Insights**: Discussion on the performance and potential improvements.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting)

## Requirements
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
